# Actively conrolled suspension
This repository contains code used during a university project at Aalborg University Esbjerg.

## Raspberry Pi

A raspberry pi was used in connection with making inertia measurements of the suspension system. The program logs accelaration data into csv files which were used in matlab.

## Matlab

Several versions of matlab projects are contained in this repository. The numbers in the folder names indicate the order in which they were made. They use the same data files, located in the logs folder.
